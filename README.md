# START: Elegant RNAseq analysis and visualization resource

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/START](https://shinyappstore.com/a/START)__

START (Shiny Transcriptome Analysis Resource Tool) App Shiny App for analysis and visualization of transcriptome data. The START App is written entirely using the Shiny framework. It is fully cross-platform. The START App has been most extensively tested in a Chrome browser environment. Analyzed data must contain some kind of expression measure for each sample (i.e. counts, normalized intensities, CPMs), and a set of p-values with corresponding fold changes for those p-values. For instance, if you have a p-value for the comparison of group1 vs group2, you can upload the observed fold change or log2(fold change) between group1 vs group2. If you have a more complex design and do not have fold changes readily available, you may upload the test statistics or other similar measures of effect size as placeholders. The fold changes are mainly used in the volcano plots. Original publication: Nelson et al. Bioinformatics . 2017 Feb 1;33(3):447-449.
